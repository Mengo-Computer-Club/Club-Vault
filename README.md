# Club Vault
## Problem Statement
In the new curiculum students are required to create documents and submit them to the teacher
but this is hindered by the labs having fewer computers. Thus needing transfers and safe storage of files.
But conventional methods like flash drives arent allowed since the can cause spread of computer viruses.
## Solution
This can be solved by having a place where these students can store their work without
being hindered by the above problems. This is through uploading them to a site called the Club Vault.

## How to run the Code
First install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the app.py

```
py app.py
```
**Note:** But if you don't have python you can get it from [the python website](https://python.org)

## Conclusion
Have fun with the code. It was made for colaboration so make edits.
